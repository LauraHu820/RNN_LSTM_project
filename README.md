# RNN_LSTM_project
Used different ML models to predict AAPL stock price in Python. Collected AAPL intraday stock data using AlphaVantage API, 
engineered lagged features and technical indicators (RSI, SMA, ATR) to create 20+ data points. Developed random forest, gradient boosting as well as RNN and LSTM from TensorFlow 
for stock prediction.
